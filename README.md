# Developing_Data_Products_Peer_Review_Assignment

This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, I created a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, I used Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about my application.

This application shows the relationship between car weight and mpg using mtcars dataset.

It has 2 histograms which you can change number of bins to see how car weight and mpg correlates, and a regression model which you can choose number of points in the model. You can also see the R squre value of the regression model - a measure of fitness of the model when you change the number of points in the model.
